TS => JS

- TypeScript is a developement too, even after writing all these code, still the project is going to run only in js.

- If any class is trying to implement any interface in it, then what all is there in the interface should be there in the class, else throws error

- Cannot instantiate an 'abstract class', just inherit the abstract class and then instantiate that new inherited class.
